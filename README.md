## üì± What is TamperGram?

TamperGram: Your Advanced Telegram Channel Dashboard

TamperGram is a browser-based, unofficial client for reading public Telegram channels and chats. It runs as a userscript on a local HTML file, creating a clean, powerful, and highly customizable dashboard to help you stay on top of your favorite content.

If you're tired of endlessly scrolling through the official app, TamperGram brings order to the chaos with an RSS-reader-like experience.

## ‚ú® Highlights
- No registration or login data needed
- Folder Organization: Group related channels into custom folders (tabs) for a tidy sidebar.
- Unread Counters: Instantly see new posts with unread badges on channels, folders, and even the browser tab title.
- Integrated Discussions: Open and read the discussion/comments for a post in a side panel without leaving the main view.
- Efficient & Lazy-Loaded: Posts are loaded intelligently as you scroll, ensuring fast performance even with thousands of messages.
- Smart Polling: Automatically checks for new posts in the background using an efficient method to find the latest content.
- Customizable Interface: Features a sleek dark theme, resizable sidebars, and numerous settings to tailor your reading experience.
- No API Required: Works by reading the public web versions of Telegram channels, so no authentication is needed.
- Profile Management: Easily export your entire setup (channels, folders, settings) to a JSON file for backup or transfer.
